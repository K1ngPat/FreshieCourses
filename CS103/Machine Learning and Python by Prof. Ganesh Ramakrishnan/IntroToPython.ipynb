If you have prior experience coding in Python, then you can skip straight to the exercises in **Part B**. If you are less familiar Python, we strongly suggest exploring each section below and running the provided example code blocks. **Focus on understanding why each line of code works and how the output can be changed**: you can add a new block using the \"+ Code\" button to test your own modifications.  \n",

Sites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/), and [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) usually have high-quality posts and troubleshooting suggestions, especially related to data analysis and machine learning applications.\n",
