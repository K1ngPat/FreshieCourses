# CS103 Resources Notes
### Regarding course structure:
First half consisted of the pdfs starting with numbers, in the order 0 to 4. These need to be done in detail and understood, for the sake of the course objectives and performance in midsems.
All the remaining materials are for the second half, and the order they were done is present in `TimeTableForSecondHalf.txt`. The particular order you do them though, isnt very important as they're all designed for beginners with 0 knowledge in CS.
These materials, however, do not need to be done in as much depth (for the sake of the exam) as those of the first half, as their goal is to simply introduce different areas of CS to you.
The required (important) topics from every lecture, that was relevant for the exam, is elucidated in `SyllabusForSecondHalf.txt`. 

Hope you enjoy this course. It may seem a drag at first, and not at all relevant to CS, but if you're someone who likes thinking and reasoning in general, you can enjoy this course.
