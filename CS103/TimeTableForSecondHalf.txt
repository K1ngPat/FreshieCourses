All,

We will not have any classes this week. We will resume the second half of the course from Dec 26 in the form of guest lectures from CSE faculty. The brief introduction to modern computing that we covered earlier will get elaborated in detail by several faculty. Below is a tentative schedule for your reference. 

We will also schedule a session for you to see your midsem answer sheets next week, after we finish grading them. I'll also put out the question paper and solutions at that time. You will also here from the TAs soon about scheduling presentations for homework 1.

Here is the schedule, for your information.
